Question 1a: What type of authentication are we using here (currently)? Does it use any
Keys?
The type of authentication being used is entering a username and a password within InfluxDB. This type of authentication does not use any keys.
Question 1b: Both TLS (encryption) and crypto authentication use public-private key pairs. For TLS encryption what keys are used when the client sends a message to the server? For crypto authentication, explain how the server can verify a message is from a given Client?
For TLS encryption, the client uses the server’s public key when sending a message to the server.
For crypto authentication, the client has to sign the message with its private key, and the server checks the signature with the client's public key in order to verify the message is authentic.
Question 2: Here we created a pair of asymmetric keys. What are their names? Which one is the public key and which one is the private key?
The two asymmetric key files created are server-key.pem and server-cert.pem. Server-key.pem is the private key, and server-cert.pem is the public key.
Question 3: What is a certificate authority (CA) for public keys? What kind of attack can
a CA prevent?
A certificate authority is a trusted organization that verifies the identity and also signs public keys. It prevents man in the middle attacks by making sure that the connection is occurring via the real server.
